    "The next step is implementing a more advanced algorithm that can better compete with the neural networks we'll evolve later. For this, I'll create a greedy agent that evaluates possible moves and selects the best one.\n",

    "To evaluate board positions effectively, I've developed a heuristic approach based on two key factors:\n",

    "2. **Strategic positioning** - Evaluating if a piece is placed in a strategically valuable location\n",
    "\n",
    "The first factor is implemented by scanning the board for potential two-piece and three-piece connections that could lead to wins. The second factor uses a position-based heatmap that assigns higher values to central columns (where more winning combinations intersect) and lower values to edge columns.\n",

    "### Minimax Agent with Alpha-Beta Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the greedy agent, which makes decisions based on immediate board evaluation, I'll now create a more sophisticated Minimax agent that can look ahead multiple moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Minimax algorithm is a recursive decision-making approach that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulates future game states** - It builds a tree of possible future positions by playing moves and counter-moves\n",
    "2. **Evaluates terminal positions** - At a specified depth or when the game ends, it evaluates the position\n",
    "3. **Propagates values backward** - The algorithm assumes optimal play from both players, with the maximizer selecting the highest values and the minimizer selecting the lowest\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve efficiency, I've implemented **Alpha-Beta pruning** which eliminates branches that cannot influence the final decision, dramatically reducing the search space without affecting the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "My implementation includes several key components:\n",
    "- A terminal state detector to identify game-ending positions\n",
    "- A static evaluation function similar to our greedy approach\n",
    "- The recursive Minimax algorithm with pruning\n",
    "- A variable depth parameter to control the search complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking ahead multiple moves, this agent should make more strategic decisions than the greedy agent, particularly in complex tactical situations where immediate evaluation is insufficient."
